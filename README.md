## Description
MongoDB is a command-line application for tracking workouts. It allows the user to view, create, and track daily workouts; log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day; and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. For cardio exercises, users can track distance traveled.
